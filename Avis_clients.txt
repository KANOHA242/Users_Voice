I love the L'Oréal foundation, it lasted all day and didn’t feel heavy.  
I don’t like the L'Oréal lipstick, it dried my lips out.  
The L'Oréal shampoo is amazing! My hair feels soft and shiny after just one wash.  
The NYX eyeshadow palette has vibrant colors, very pigmented.  
The NYX eyeliner smudged easily, I’m disappointed.  
I adore the NYX setting spray, it keeps my makeup in place for hours.  
The Maybelline mascara really makes my lashes look longer and fuller!  
The Maybelline concealer didn’t cover my dark circles well.  
I love the Maybelline matte lipstick, it lasts without cracking.  
The Maybelline nail polish chips too quickly, I’m not happy with it.
